The frontpage is broken into the following:

 a) A summary of the activity on issues related to the current user.

 b) A list of assigned and watched bugs, ordered by how recently somebody
    *other* than the current user has acted on them. There are additionally
    other orderings that can be applied to the bug list, but that is the
    default.

Additionally, the following pages are available from the frontpage.

 a) A list of projects, both active and inactive. The active projects are
    listed in both the default 'projects' page and also from a menu displayed
    when 'Projects' is moused over in the navigation. Inactive projects may
    be shown is the 'inactive' tab on the project page is selected.

    [Aside: should projects be taggable for discovery purposes?]

 b) Project pages. These all active bugs. The ordering here is simpler and
    the default is in reverse order of bug ID.

Issues may be tagged. There are a fixed set of initial tags shared by all
projects initially ('bug', 'duplicate', 'enhancement', 'invalid', 'question',
'wontfix'), but additional tags may be added. A project's tag listing.
